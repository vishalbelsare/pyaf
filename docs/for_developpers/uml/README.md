# FOR DEVELOPPERS ONLY !!!

These are some class diagrams which will help you understand the structure of PyAF code. These diagrams are provided as png image files.

This is a set of diagrams generated automatically by the excellent tool umbrello from PyAF python code on 2023-03-20.

Umbrello internal xmi files are provided. They have been checked by the main developper of PyAF.

There will be no support for this part. It is here, only for your information (and to make some software integrators life easier ;-).
